# 2048

## This is my clone of the [2048](https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048) clone game using Java Swing.
* This is a project for fun. My goal was to recreate the features of the 2048 clone as closely as possible. 

### Notable Features
* Responsive sizing
* Score update animation
* Tile merge animation
* Tile spawn animation
